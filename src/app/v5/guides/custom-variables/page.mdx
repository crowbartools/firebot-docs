# **Custom Variable Effects**

The Custom Variable effect allows you to store data for use in Firebot later. This is useful for creating dynamic, personalized effects for your stream.  {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can find it in the “Select New Effect” box when adding a new effect. It’s listed under the “ALL,” “Advanced,” and “Scripting” tabs. Custom Variables function similarly to variables in programming but can always be overwritten (they cannot be made constant).  {{ className: 'lead' }}

By leveraging Custom Variables, you can make your stream more interactive and tailor effects to your viewers. For more advanced logic, check out the [Conditional Effects guide](/v5/guides/conditional-effects). {{ className: 'lead' }}

## **Configuring a Custom Variable**

### **Variable Name**
This is where you name your variable. Use a descriptive name without spaces (e.g., `randomViewer`) to avoid issues and make the variable's purpose clear. A common practice is using CamelCase, where each word starts with a capital letter except the first (e.g., `contestWinner`).

### **Variable Data**
Here, input the data you want to save. This can be any type of data, including Firebot's built-in variables accessed via the `$vars` button.

### **Property Path (Optional)**
This is used for accessing or modifying specific parts of complex data structures like arrays or objects. Most users can skip this section, but here’s a quick overview:

- **Array Example:** `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`  
  Access "banana" with `$$myArray[1]`.

- **Object Example:** `{"fruit":"apple", "color":"red"}`  
  Access "apple" with `$$myObject[fruit]`.

- **Array of Objects Example:**  
  `[{"fruit":"apple"}, {"fruit":"banana"}]`  
  Access "apple" with `$$myArray[0, fruit]`.

You can use the Property Path field to update a specific part of the variable without overwriting the entire structure.

<Note type="info">
    **Example**: To change the color of a fruit from red to yellow in `{"fruit":"apple", "color":"red"}`, set `Variable Name` to your object’s name, `Variable Data` to `yellow`, and `Property Path` to `color`.
</Note>

### **Duration (Optional)**
Set how long Firebot should retain the variable (in seconds). By default (`0`), variables persist until Firebot is closed. Enable **Settings > Advanced > Persist Custom Variables** to retain them across sessions.

<Note type="info">
    **Example**: Set `90` to store a variable for 1 minute and 30 seconds, useful for timed events like competitions.
</Note>

## **Using a Custom Variable**

Custom Variables are placeholders for text data that you can reuse in other effects. Examples include saving usernames, answers, timestamps, or messages.

### **Accessing a Custom Variable**
You can access a Custom Variable in any effect by using one of the following replace variables:
- `$customVariable[variableName]`
- `$$variableName` (shortcut)

<Note type="info">
    **Example**: If you save a contest winner’s name as `contestWinner`, you can use `$$contestWinner` in any effect to display the name.
</Note>

### Example: Chat Contest

**Premise**: Let's say we start a contest for chat members and the first person to write the correct answer in chat to a riddle wins a prize, and we want to save the persons name for later.

1. **Save the Winner:**  
   Set up a chat event to check messages. Use a **Conditional Effect** (More on those [here](/v5/guides/conditional-effects)) to detect the correct answer.<br />When triggered:
   - Turn off the chat event with a **Toggle Event** effect.
   - Save the winner’s username using a **Custom Variable**. Set:
     - `Variable Name`: `contestWinner`
     - `Variable Data`: `$user` (Firebot’s built-in variable for the triggering user’s name)

2. **Announce the Winner:**  
   Use a **Chat Effect** with:  
   `"Congratulations to $$contestWinner for guessing correctly! You win today's prize!"`

## **Custom Variable Inspector**

The Custom Variable Inspector is a useful tool for viewer and debugging your variables. You can access it under the “Tools” menu in Firebot.
